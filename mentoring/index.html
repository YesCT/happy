                hours, someone could not show up and need a replacement, at
                an in person sprint, ask for volunteers to do a small thing,

            </li>
            <li>give would-be mentors a first mentor task they can succeed
                at. For example, if a new participant is having trouble
                setting up webserver in linux, ask a would be mentor that
                you know is comfortable with that. Dont ask a would-be
                mentor to help someone do a Mac set up, if they dont already
                know. Dont ask them to help someone with a call back
                conversion if they have never themselves done one. Save
                asking them to do something they dont know the answer to for
                later.
            </li>
            <li>help without being overbearing, overhear them in their first
                mentoring interactions, stay around the same table, watch
                the conversation in irc.
            </li>
            <li>thank them.</li>
            <li>say one thing they did well. “you were patient when it took

    <h4>It's the people,</h4>
    <h2>It's also the tools!</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
	    I'm an example of a contributor who became involved in Drupal because of it's wonderful community. I started my research on open source communities in 2009. At that time I was interested in studying the usability movement in open source, so I picked a number of open srouce communities that care about usability, Drupal was one of them. I started to contact community members and read the bug repositories. After six months I decided to only focus on Drupal. I felt welcomed by the responses that I got from Drupal contributors, I was impressed with the way they worked together to make a better Drupal, and I've been involved in Drupal since then. So, the people and community is important, But, even with a welcoming community, people wont contribute if contributing is difficult. The tools that we use as a community to connect and collaborate have a lot of room for improvement. I think it's time for us to take a closer look at the tools we are using today, find the problems, and improve them.

    <img src="images/issue-queue2.png" width="100%" height="100%" style='border:1px solid #000000'>
    <aside class="notes">
        The most commonly used tool in Drupal community is the issue queue. A good thing about issue queue is that it's fairly easy to use. You just write a comment and click save, or write down a description of an issue and click save. It's easy once you know what to write. But coming to the point that you come up with the right content for the comment you are writing is not so much easy. You often need to go over a process to be able to post a meaningful comment. For example, there are times that you need to post a comment to mediate between other participants with conflicting opinions. In order to do that, you need carefully examine each person's view points, and write a comment to resolve the conflict. But, this may involve talking to them individually on IRC, seeking for an expert opinion on a technical detail, or coming up with a third solution that makes both parties happy. So, contributing to the issue queue is not just writing a comment and clicking save, it's a social process.

            This means that the Drupal community have chosen to care more about the process than the result. They don't only care about the final solution, but they care more about the process of coming to that solution. This is why a consensus building process have been chosen rather than voting.

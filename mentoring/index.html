        mentor in public, in a public channel in irc, or in a room where
        people can overhear interactions between mentors and participants.

            <li>In a pinch, when there is a real need, ask (busy office
                hours, someone could not show up and need a replacement, at
                an in person sprint, ask for volunteers to do a small thing,
                something they would-be-mentor *is* comfortable with.
            </li>
            <li>give would-be mentors a first mentor task they can succeed
                at. For example, if a new participant is having trouble
                setting up webserver in linux, ask a would be mentor that
                you know is comfortable with that. Dont ask a would-be
                mentor to help someone do a Mac set up, if they dont already
                know. Dont ask them to help someone with a call back
                conversion if they have never themselves done one. Save
                asking them to do something they dont know the answer to for
                later.
            </li>
            <li>help without being overbearing, overhear them in their first
                mentoring interactions, stay around the same table, watch
                the conversation in irc.
            </li>
            <li>thank them.</li>
            <li>say one thing they did well. “you were patient when it took
                them 15 minutes to find their php.ini” “your explanation of
                interdiffs really helped that new participant”

        Tell stories of us being turned into mentors.

    <h4>It's the people,</h4>
    <h2>but we need tools to support people!</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
	    I started my research on open source communities on 2009. At that time I was interested in studying the usability movement in open source, so I picked a number of open srouce communities that care about usability, Drupal was one of them. I started to contact community members and read the bug repositories. After six months I decided to only focus on Drupal. I felt welcomed by the responses  that I got from Drupal contributors, I was impressed with the way they worked together to make a better Drupal, and I've been involved in Drupal since then. I'm an example of a contributor who has been engaged in Drupal because of it's wonderful community. But, I found the tools that the community members use rather primitive. Even with a welcoming community, people wont contribute if contributing is difficult. I think it's time for us to as a community to take a closer look at the tools we are using today to contribute to Drupal, find the problems, and improve them.
        <p>Changes to the tools will really help.</p>

    <h3>Issues are resolved based on community <span style="color:#52B0E9">consensus</span></h3>
        <aside class="notes">
            Before we go into some areas of improvement in the Drupal issue queue, it's important to know the culture of the issue queue. 
            <p></p>

<section>
    <h3>The <span style="color:#52B0E9">social process</span> matters as much as the result.</h3>
        <aside class="notes">
            This means that the Drupal community have chosen to care more about the process than the result. They don't only care about the final solution, but they care more about the process of coming to that solution. This is why a consensus building process have been chosen rather than voting.
        </aside>

<section>
    <h3>But the issue queue doesn't support the social process...</h3>
        <aside class="notes">
            The issue queue has a lot of advantages such as being easy to use, but it doesn't explicitly support the process of coming to consensus and resolving an issue.

<section>
    <h3>Or to figure out the current direction of the discussion</h3>
    <aside class="notes">
        It’s often hard to figure out what is the current direction of the discussion. Often it takes getting someone to clarify it. And not everyone would clarify it the same way.  If there are two people, and they’re each kind of pushing their own ideas, within a Drupal issue and you go on IRC and ask each of them individually, what’s the current direction?, you’ll get two very different answers.

    <h3>If we care about the process, we need to design for supporting the process...</h3>
    <aside class="notes">
        We are facing all these problems because the design of the issue queue doesn't fully conider the process of participating in the discussion. Process inclusds understanding the discussion, dealing with conflicts, clarifying confusions, etc.
